<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://efieldsim.ithaca.edu/site/game.html)

Because electric fields cannot be touched or seen, simulations are often utilized to build students' understanding of them by providing them with a visual of electric fields and the motion of test charges through them. The objective of the simulation is to improve students’ qualitative understanding of how electric fields are impacted by a configuration of charges by creating a dynamic representation of the electric field lines, field vectors, equipotential lines and the voltage created by the charges on screen. After creating a charge configuration, the simulation visualizes the motion of test charges through the electric field. 
The core physics principles of the simulation have also been used as the foundation of the mechanics of an educational game. Our aim in the gamification of the simulation is to improve motivation and engagement in the material. Both the simulation and game were built in JavaScript so they will run on most browsers on a computer or mobile device. 


Learning Objectives:
* Predict the general shape and direction of electric field lines for a system of charges
* Relate the shape of equipotential lines to the shape of electric field lines
* Compare the curve of the electric field lines to the trajectory of a test charge


### Languages Used

The entire game runs inside a canvas tag in a webpage. HTML and CSS are used to set up the page then p5.js creates the canvas with the game loop and everything else. Everything else is done in Javascript.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Design

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Mayer's 

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```





<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
